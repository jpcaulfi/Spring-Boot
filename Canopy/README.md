# Canopy

An application I'm building for my delivery team at Amazon: RP Manley Co.

The intention is to provide drivers with a platform to bid on what we call "rescues".

A rescue is when one driver has no remaining packages and picks up a specified number of packages (or stops) off of another driver.
This procedure is mandatory and occurs at management's discretion.

With Canopy, all of the metrics for a driver's performance (stop speed, rescues done, attendance, etc.) are recorded and formulated into a score: the Canopy Score.
Whoever has the higher Canopy Score wins the bid for the rescue, and they get paid a bonus for every stop they pick up on a rescue!

The bidding occurs in a chat server and a bot selects the winner within a specified time period.

With this application, I firmly believe drivers will be incentivized to finish their own routes faster and conduct rescues willingly.
Thus, Canopy will increase the overall efficiency of the company and flip the most dreaded part of any driver's day to the most exciting.



** Note ** 


'CANOPY-COMPILER' is a work-around program responsible for populating the database and querying specific data from select tables to other select tables. It serves this purpose to accumulate data and build frameworks while the actual application is being constructed.


'CANOPY-V5' is the full-stack application which is built using Spring Boot in Java and will be complete with a back-end (either MySQL or PostgreSQL), Discord chat user implementation, and a React.js web terminal interface.
