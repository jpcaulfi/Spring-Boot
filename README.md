# Spring-Boot

Various full-stack projects I've built using React.js, Spring Boot, and backend databases.

"Canopy" is a bidding platform I built for my team at Amazon.

"Movie Theater" is a movie theater app I built to showcase my skills in Spring Boot.

"Goliath" is my most recent deep-learning infused project designed to develop precise stock market speculation tactics.
This application is a work in progress and I will posting my progress as I develop further.
